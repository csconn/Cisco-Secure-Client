Cisco Secure Client, formerly known as AnyConnect, delivers secure remote access to end users. It combines robust security functions with reliable enterprise network connections. This guide outlines the steps to deploy, configure, and troubleshoot the client efficiently.

## Cisco Secure Client Deployment Methods

The choice of deployment method depends on your organization’s infrastructure and operational needs:

> **Predeployment**: Installed manually or via enterprise software distribution systems like SMS.

> **Web Deployment**: Automatically installs when a user connects to supported devices such as Secure Firewall ASA, ISE, or Threat Defense.

> **Cloud Management Deployment**: Deployed and overseen using the Cisco Secure Client Cloud Management platform.

Each approach comes with unique benefits and prerequisites, detailed in the subsequent sections.

## Predeploying Cisco Secure Client

Predeployment involves installing Cisco Secure Client either manually or through enterprise management tools.
